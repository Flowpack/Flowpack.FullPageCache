      cookieParams:
        # ignored cookie params exclude cookies that are handled by the frontend
        # and are not relevant for the backend. A usecase would be gdpr consent cookies
        # if they are only used on the client side.
        # Example:
        #  - 'consent_settings'
        #  => If the cookie "consent_settings" is present, it will be cached.
        #     But if a "_ga" cookie is present, the request will not be cached.
        # Important: Only evaluated if "respect" is empty!
        ignore: []

        # respected cookie params are relevant for the backend and will skip the caching.
        # Example:

        #  => If the "Neos_Session" cookie is present in the request, it will not be cached.

        # ignored arguments are not part of the cache identifier but do not
        # prevent caching either. Use this for arguments that are meaningless for
        # the backend like utm_campaign

        #  - 'utm_campaign'
        #  => If the "utm_campaign" argument is present in the request, it will be cached.

        # Important: Only evaluated if "respect" is empty!
        ignore: []

        # respected arguments are relevant for the backend and will skip the caching.
        # All other arguments will be ignored and cached as if they weren't there.
        # Example:
        #  - 'search'
        #  => If the "search" argument is present in the request, it will not be cached.
        #     But if a "utm_source" argument is present, the request will be cached as if the argument wouldn't be there.
